We can categorise "Developing Software" as a complicated problem following the Cynefin Framework, a problem that we know what needs to be done, we explore multiple options and finally we implement one of them.
But, is it always the reality? We have seen a lot the following picture where a customer wanted X but instead we delivered Y.
Moreover, this uncertainty not only applies to the features we need to implement in a product, but also when writing software. How many times have you written a code that you thought it would solve the problem and finally didn't?

If we look closer to the definition of "Engineering" from wikipedia it says:
> Engineering is the use of scientific principles to design and build machines, structures, and other items, including bridges, tunnels, roads, vehicles, and buildings.

And if we look at the definition of **scientific principles** we come up with this diagram:

It clearly states that this process consists on observing the problem, researching multiple solutions, formulate an hypothesis, test your hypothesis with an experiment, analyze the results, drive conclusions and start again until you finally solve your problem.
Usually this process is called Feedback loop, and over the last years there have been many strategies proposed to shorten this feedback loop. 
**The shorter the feedback loop is, the faster we will get to conclusions and, therefore, the faster we will deliver the right thing to our customers.**

In this series of posts I will explain the different strategies that have been used and most importantly, categorize them based on how long/short is feedback loop when you use them in a development team.
