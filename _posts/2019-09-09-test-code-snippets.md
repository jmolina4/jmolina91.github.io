The 7th of January I joined ThoughtWorks Spain as Senior Consultant. For those who don’t know the company, Thoughtworks is a 25 years old international consultancy known for the high-quality software they deliver following good practises such as TDD or Pair Programming (and because of Martin Fowler, of course). After 8 months, having worked in two different clients and three different projects, I thought it would be great to write some lines what were the expectations I had around this company when I joined and how they were satisfied or not during this time.
<br/><br/>

## Full Stack Developer

One of the reasons why I joined ThoughtWorks was to expand my technical breadth. It means learning more programming languages and technologies, working with different architectures and setting up different applications. As a software engineer, I felt that the more tech breath you have as a developer, the more tools you will have available to solve a problem. Moreover, as an Agile practitioner, I wanted to be part of a real Cross-functional team to be able to develop a feature from the beginning until the end.

During my 8 months, I've been working with different types of applications (serverless, monoliths and microservices), multiple frontend technologies such as Flow, Typescript, React and Redux, a variety of backend languages like Go, Scala and C# and finally a couple of Infrastructure as Code programming languages, Terraform and CloudFromation. Probably, touching so many things in less than a year is not a common pattern at ThoughtWorks because when you are assigned to a client, they expect you to be there around one year, but, what is true is that they expect you to be able to deliver value regardless of the programming language.

## Agile Mindset

In most of my previous companies, I’ve been working on an “agile” way but, as usually happens, you don’t know if you are doing it in the right way or not. When I joined ThoughtWorks I expected to see the perfect way of doing Scrum or Kanban since Martin Fowler, the Chief Scientist Office, was one of the creators of the Agile Manifesto.

The main thing I have learnt at ThoughtWorks is that Agile is not about Scrum or Kanban, it is about being moving quickly towards goal getting feedback constantly. That being said, I've worked with both Scrum and Kanban at ThoughtWorks but none of them was implemented by the book, instead, we have followed a custom approach adapted to the team I was working in.
<br/><br/>

## Software Excellence

ThoughtWorks is well known for aiming to put good practises in place like TDD, CI/CD, Pair Programming among others. Therefore I expected to see all those things fully implemented in every client they work with.

Surprisingly, all the projects I’ve worked with had all those things set up by default so there was no need for convincing the client about the value of those practices. When ThoughtWorks starts a relationship with a client, those are well defined and understood by the client because at the end this is how ThoughtWorks delivers high quality.

## People

My expectations here were not clear, to be honest. On the one side, ThoughtWorks is a consultancy with a lot of people working on it, but on the other side, they just moved to Barcelona so a "startup" mood would also be possible.
And sincerely, People here is amazing! As I said I've been working on three different projects and everybody from ThoughtWorks is always willing to help you, open-minded and open to get feedback at any point in time to improve personally and professionally. Since "Social and Economic Justice" is our third pillar, ThoughtWorks has the most inclusive culture I've ever seen which means we treat everybody equally regardless of gender, age or race.

## Conclusion

It has been already 8 months at ThoughtWorks and as I can say I am very happy with the change I had in my career. I moved from being a Lead in my previous company to become again Senior Developer so that I could reinforce my tech skills. So far, I have worked with many different programming languages, I've improved my knowledge in Agile and I've practised some of the best practises that help you to develop high-quality code. So far so good!
